        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> I have been taking courses in data science from <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a> for the past two years. During that
				time, I got introduced to a wonderful resource called R. R is an open source statistical program and much, much, 
				<em>MUCH</em> more. I got the chance to work with different types of data but none of them were data about the 
				Philippines. </p>
		<p> Unlike countries like the USA, New Zealand, or the UK, data from the Philippines is difficult to access. We have one of
				the slowest internet speed in the world and the infrastructure to provide data to the public is still in its infancy.
				This site I hope will be a forum to share resources where data about the Philippines can be shared and explored 
				cooperatively. </p>
        <p> I also intend this site to be a place where I can share the tremendous experience I had working with R, the R community, 
				Coursera and to	promote appreciation of data among Filipinos. </p>
